            <h1>Engineering Physics Co-op (B.Eng.)</h1>
            <p>"In Engineering Physics, we create advanced materials, devices and systems based on our 
                fundamental understanding of physics. Our faculty and students are pushing the envelope 
                of new technologies to solve the grand challenges of the future such as energy supply, 
                human health, and information and communications technologies." - McMaster University</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> Engineering Physics means a lot to me. As a first year engineering student I found that 
                I had a wide variety of interests throughout my courses. I liked learning about semiconductors
                in Materials Science, algorithms in Computer Science, the unintuitive physics in Electricity
                and Magnetism, and several other areas of first year. Given that McMaster Engineering starts
                you in a general path and requires you to specialize into an Engineering stream after, this
                caused me some worry at first. Having done a highschool Co-Op in the department, I already had
                some knowledge about Engineering Physics, the program that teaches areas of computation, circuit 
                design, several areas of physics, and points out all the ways they synergize together. Given my
                wide range of interest and the freedom given to customize our own degree, I chose Eng Phys. My 
                current goals and aspirations are to further develop my knowledge of applied Quantum Mechanics
                and combine it with my experience in computational methods in an interesting way. This could be
                through analyis of nanotechnology like photovoltaics or nanowires, or even Quantum Computers.</p>
